<!-- From Andy's Notes: The <h1> tag stands for "heading 1". Heading tags go all the way up to <h6>. Lower numbered headings indicate content that is more important. -->
<h1>Stage 0: Important Concepts</h1>

<h2>How the Web Works</h2>
<p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate
  with each other. A person types in a domain name to access a web
  page using a computer browser such as Chrome, Opera, Safari, or, when desperate, Internet Explorer. When the person goes to the web page, the computer sends
  an <b>HTTP Request</b> to a <b>Server</b>. The
  server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
  it back to the user's computer where said web browser
  interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

<br><br>This <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=49&v=kzyfIiVZPJA">Components of the Web Video</a></b>
  does a good job of explaining the concept.
</p>

<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>HTML stands for <b>Hypertext Markup Language.</b> HTML documents form the majority of the
  content on the web. HTML documents contain <b>text content</b> which describes "what you see"
  and <b>markup</b> which describes "how it looks".

  <br><br>This <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=45&v=5Kjx-NOwcSc">
  Intro to HTML Video</a></b> gives a good overview.
</p>

<h2>Tags and Elements</h2>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. An element begins with an opening tag and ends with a closing tag. When
  writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.

  <br><br>This <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=45&v=VsxbuJWcxqA">Into to HTML Tags Video</a></b>
  explains the distinction well.

<h2>Why Computers are Stupid</h2>
<p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
  literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a
  small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems
  in a program.
</p>

<h2>Programmers Don't Have to Know Everything</h2>
<p>There are so many details involved with coding. A rookie mistake is to try to memorize everything. It is more common to copy and paste bits of code, and Google will become your best friend.<br><br>That is why I actually used Andy's Notes as the foundation of the assignment and tweaked it for my purposes. (I hope that this is allowed!) :-)
</p>

<h2>Inline vs Block Elements</h2>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them while inline elements appear, well, inline. Go figure.
